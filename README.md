My presentation at [The Cube](http://thecube.gr) for the Drupal Meetup of Athens, Greece for the 18th of December, 2015 describing the Node Access of Drupal and how it is may be manipulated from a module's code.
The presentation is built on top of the great [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js).
